# Python Essentials – My Learning Journey 🐍

Welcome to my Python learning repository! This contains all the important core concepts and libraries I’ve practiced and learned — helpful for beginners and intermediate learners alike.

---

## 📘 Topics Covered

### 🔹 1. Variables and Data Types
Learn about different data types in Python like integers, floats, strings, booleans, and how variables are used to store them.

---

### 🔹 2. Strings
Explore string creation, indexing, slicing, and built-in string methods like `upper()`, `lower()`, `split()`, and more.

---

### 🔹 3. Lists
Understand how to create, access, modify, and loop through lists. Includes list methods and list comprehensions.

---

### 🔹 4. Tuples
Work with immutable sequences, understand tuple packing and unpacking, and learn how they differ from lists.

---

### 🔹 5. Sets
Learn about unordered collections with no duplicate elements, along with set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

---

### 🔹 6. Dictionaries
Dive into key-value pairs, how to create dictionaries, access elements, loop through them, and use dictionary methods.

---

### 🔹 7. Loops
Use `for` and `while` loops to perform repetitive tasks, and understand control statements like `break`, `continue`, and `pass`.

---

### 🔹 8. Functions
Create reusable blocks of code with arguments, return values, default parameters, and explore scope and recursion.

---

### 🔹 9. Classes and Objects
Learn the basics of Object-Oriented Programming — defining classes, creating objects, using constructors, and class methods.

---

### 🔹 10. Exception Handling
Handle runtime errors gracefully using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks.

---

### 🔹 11. Comprehensions
Simplify your code with list, dictionary, and set comprehensions — a Pythonic way to write clean, short loops.

---

### 🔹 12. Lambda Functions
Use anonymous functions with `lambda` for quick one-line operations.

---

### 🔹 13. Map, Reduce, and Filter
Understand how to apply functional programming tools for transformation, aggregation, and filtering.

---

### 🔹 14. NumPy
Work with high-performance arrays, mathematical operations, and matrix transformations using NumPy.

---

### 🔹 15. Pandas
Perform data manipulation and analysis using Pandas DataFrames and Series.

---

### 🔹 16. Matplotlib
Visualize data with line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, and more using Matplotlib.
