# 🐍 Python Learning Journey by Pranavi

Welcome to my Python Learning Repository!  
This repository is a collection of core Python concepts that I’ve learned, practiced, and documented — from basics to essential libraries. It serves as my personal reference as well as a learning aid for anyone starting out with Python.

## 📘 Topics Covered

### 🔹 1. Variables & Data Types
- Understand how Python stores and manages data.
- Covered types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, `list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`.
- Type conversions using built-in functions (`int()`, `str()`, etc).

### 🔹 2. Strings
- String creation, indexing, and slicing.
- Common methods like `.upper()`, `.lower()`, `.replace()`.
- String formatting using `f-strings`.

### 🔹 3. Lists
- Ordered, mutable collection of elements.
- Operations: `append()`, `insert()`, `remove()`, `pop()`, `sort()`.
- Nested lists and list iteration.

### 🔹 4. Tuples
- Immutable sequences.
- Useful for fixed data like coordinates.
- Can be unpacked and indexed.

### 🔹 5. Sets
- Unordered collections with no duplicates.
- Useful for membership testing and mathematical operations like union, intersection.

### 🔹 6. Dictionaries
- Store key-value pairs.
- Useful for structured data like JSON.
- Operations: `get()`, `update()`, `keys()`, `values()`.

### 🔹 7. Loops
- `for` and `while` loops to automate tasks.
- Use of `break`, `continue`, `pass` for control flow.

### 🔹 8. Functions
- Defined using `def`, used for reusable blocks of code.
- Covers parameters, return values, and scope.

### 🔹 9. Classes and Objects (OOP)
- Basics of Object-Oriented Programming in Python.
- Use of `__init__`, `self`, and methods.
- Class attributes vs. instance attributes.

### 🔹 10. Exception Handling
- Handling runtime errors using `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally`.

### 🔹 11. Comprehensions
- One-line expressions for creating `lists`, `sets`, and `dicts`.
- Syntax: `[x for x in iterable if condition]`.

### 🔹 12. Lambda, Map, Filter, Reduce
- **Lambda**: Anonymous functions for short tasks.
- **Map**: Apply function to each element in a list.
- **Filter**: Filter elements based on a condition.
- **Reduce**: Apply rolling computation to list (from `functools`).

### 🔹 13. Pandas
- Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- Concepts: Series, DataFrame, indexing, filtering, grouping, merging.

### 🔹 14. NumPy
- Powerful numerical computation library.
- Arrays, broadcasting, vectorized operations.

### 🔹 15. Matplotlib
- Visualization library for plotting data.
- Types: Line charts, bar plots, histograms, scatter plots.
